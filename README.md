# Homework
Unless otherwise stated, this repo contains my (uncorrected) solutions to assignments from my courses at the University of Washington. I've made this repo public as a resource, but please practice academic integrity when viewing said resource. 

A few comments:
In general, I do not TeX problem statements but I still do not take credit for them. When problems were assigned from a text, said text can be found in the course folder.

The latex-defs.sty and jlcode.sty files will often be required to compile my .tex files and are included in the main folder. The latex-defs file has gone through several iterations, so an alternative latex-defs.tex file is included in the folders of assignments that require that instead.
